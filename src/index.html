                    By downloading or using our Service, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using our platform. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the platform, any part of the platform, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of our platform, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the platform into other languages or make derivative versions. The platform itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Point 'N Save, LLC.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Point 'N Save, LLC is committed to ensuring that the platform is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the platform or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The [Point 'N Save] platform stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the platform secure. We, therefore, recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the [Point 'N Save] platform won’t work properly or at all.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    You should be aware that there are certain things that Point 'N Save, LLC will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the platform will require active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Point 'N Save, LLC cannot take responsibility for the platform not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you’re using the platform outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the platform, or other third party charges. In using the platform, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the platform outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the platform, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the platform.
                    Along the same lines, Point 'N Save, LLC cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the platform i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Point 'N Save, LLC cannot accept responsibility.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    With respect to Point 'N Save’s responsibility for your use of the platform, when you’re using the platform, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Point 'N Save, LLC accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the platform.
